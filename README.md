🚗 Vehicle Detection and Counting System using Computer Vision 🚗

I'm excited to share my latest project, a Vehicle Detection and Counting System developed using computer vision techniques! 📷🔍

In this project, I utilized Python and OpenCV to create a robust system capable of detecting and counting vehicles in real-time from video footage. The system employs background subtraction and morphology operations to highlight moving vehicles, and bounding rectangles are drawn around the detected vehicles for visual reference. The key features of this project include:

🔹 Accurate Vehicle Detection: The system accurately detects vehicles of varying sizes by applying Gaussian blur and morphological operations to the video frames. This ensures reliable vehicle identification under different lighting and environmental conditions.

🔹 Real-time Counting: By tracking the movement of vehicles crossing a designated detection line, the system dynamically counts the number of vehicles passing through the monitored area. The count is displayed on the video feed in real-time, providing valuable traffic insights.

🔹 User-friendly Interface: The system provides an intuitive user interface that showcases the original video feed alongside the detected vehicles. Bounding rectangles and center-point circles are overlaid on the video to visualize the detected vehicles and their movement.

Whether it's for traffic management, security surveillance, or data-driven decision-making, this Vehicle Detection and Counting System offers a versatile solution that can be applied to various scenarios. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and expanding my skills in computer vision and Python programming.
